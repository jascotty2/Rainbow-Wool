RainbowWool
Bring colour to your wool

RainbowWool is an innovative way to bring colour to wool based on redstone input. 
Usually, dyes are required to get wool to change to anything other than dull old white. 
With RainbowWool, a simple redstone circuit could change everything.

RainbowWool uses the strength of nearby redstone current to set colours of wool. 
For every increase in current by 1, the wool will change colour to the corresponding data value. 
Use RainbowWool to brighten up your skyscraper, colourise your disco or maybe even create a colour display.
